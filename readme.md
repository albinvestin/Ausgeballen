---Instructions---
In this game you control a Ballen with a rotating gun. You shoot using a
selected key and score points when you hit the other players. The only way
to move is through recoil or bouncing off other Ballen. The first Ballen to
score 10 points is declared the biggest Ballen and wins the game.
